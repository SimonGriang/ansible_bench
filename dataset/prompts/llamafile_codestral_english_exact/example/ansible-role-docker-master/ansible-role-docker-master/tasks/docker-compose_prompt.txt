You are a professional developer. Below you will receive task descriptions from which you should generate an Ansible Playbook. Name the tasks exactly as I provide them here:

Task 1: Check current docker-compose version.
Description Task 1: Run the docker-compose command to fetch the current version installed on the system. If the command fails, it should not cause the playbook to fail.

Task 2: Set current docker-compose version.
Description Task 2: Extract the version number from the output of the docker-compose version command and set it as a variable for further use.

Task 3: Delete existing docker-compose version.
Description Task 3: If the current docker-compose version is defined and it's different from the desired version, delete the existing docker-compose installation.

Task 4: Install Docker Compose.
Description Task 4: If the current docker-compose version is not defined, or it's not the same as the desired version, download and install the Docker Compose binary.
